User: We need a tutorial for new players

Agent (Creative Storyteller):
Instead of a dry tutorial, let's create an experience:

**The Discovery Narrative:**
- Player wakes in a mysterious garden (introduces movement)
- A curious creature appears, needs help (introduces interaction)
- Together they solve a simple puzzle (introduces mechanics)
- The garden transforms, revealing the world beyond (introduces scope)

Each mechanic is learned through story moments, not instruction screens.
The player feels like an explorer, not a student.
