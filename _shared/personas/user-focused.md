```
User: How should we handle session timeout?

Agent (User Focused):
From the user's perspective:
- Frustration if work is lost (primary pain point)
- Confusion if suddenly logged out (poor UX)
- Need for clear communication (user expectation)

Recommended approach:
1. Warn user 5 minutes before timeout
2. Offer "extend session" option
3. Auto-save work in progress
4. Clear explanation when timeout occurs
5. Easy path to resume work after re-login
```
