  <critical>Challenge everything: Are tasks marked [x] actually done? Are ACs really implemented?</critical>
  <critical>Find 3-10 specific issues in every review minimum - no lazy "looks good" reviews - YOU are so much better than the dev agent

    <action>Extract ALL Tasks/Subtasks with completion status ([x] vs [ ])</action>
    <action>From Dev Agent Record → File List, compile list of claimed changes</action>

      2. **Task Audit**: Verify each [x] task is really done
      3. **Code Quality**: Security, performance, maintainability
      4. **Test Quality**: Real tests vs placeholder bullshit

  </step>

  <step n="3" goal="Execute adversarial review">
    <critical>VALIDATE EVERY CLAIM - Check git reality vs story claims</critical>

    <!-- Git vs Story Discrepancies -->
    <action>Review git vs story File List discrepancies:
      1. **Files changed but not in story File List** → MEDIUM finding (incomplete documentation)
      2. **Story lists files but no git changes** → HIGH finding (false claims)
      3. **Uncommitted changes not documented** → MEDIUM finding (transparency issue)
    </action>

    <!-- Use combined file list: story File List + git discovered files -->
    <action>Create comprehensive review file list from story File List and git changes</action>

    <!-- AC Validation -->
    <action>For EACH Acceptance Criterion:
      1. Read the AC requirement
      2. Search implementation files for evidence
      3. Determine: IMPLEMENTED, PARTIAL, or MISSING
      4. If MISSING/PARTIAL → HIGH SEVERITY finding
    </action>

    <!-- Task Completion Audit -->
    <action>For EACH task marked [x]:
      1. Read the task description
      2. Search files for evidence it was actually done
      3. **CRITICAL**: If marked [x] but NOT DONE → CRITICAL finding
      4. Record specific proof (file:line)
    </action>

    <!-- CRITICAL: Content Verification (Added 2025-12-11) -->
    <action>For tasks claiming "files created", verify content matches specification:
      1. **Identify file creation claims**: Look for tasks like "[x] Created N files" or File List entries marked as "New Files"
      2. **Sample file verification**: Read at least 2-3 sample files (beginning, middle, end of sequence)
      3. **Content vs Spec check**: Compare actual file content against story requirements
      4. **Example**: If story says "microagent files for requirements→architecture→code workflow", verify files actually contain that workflow (not some other workflow)
      5. **CRITICAL**: If files exist but contain WRONG content → CRITICAL finding (worse than missing files!)
      6. Record: file path, expected content, actual content
    </action>

    <action>For stories with file loading code, trace what gets loaded:
      1. **Find loading functions**: Search for glob(), open(), read file patterns
      2. **Trace one execution**: Follow the code path to see what files it loads
      3. **Verify loaded content**: Check that loaded files contain expected data structure/format
      4. **Example**: If code loads "step-00-*.md" files, verify step-00 files match expected template
      5. **CRITICAL**: If code loads wrong files or files have wrong format → HIGH finding
    </action>

    <action>Spot-check completed tasks for accuracy:
      1. **Select 20% of [x] tasks randomly** (minimum 2 tasks)
      2. **Deep verification**: Read implementation, trace to requirements
      3. **Acceptance**: Task is truly complete, not just "looks done"
      4. **If spot check fails** → Audit ALL [x] tasks (trust is broken)
      5. Record: which tasks verified, which failed spot check
    </action>

    <!-- Code Quality Deep Dive -->
    <action>For EACH file in comprehensive review list:
      1. **Security**: Look for injection risks, missing validation, auth issues
      2. **Performance**: N+1 queries, inefficient loops, missing caching
      3. **Error Handling**: Missing try/catch, poor error messages
      4. **Code Quality**: Complex functions, magic numbers, poor naming
      5. **Test Quality**: Are tests real assertions or placeholders?
