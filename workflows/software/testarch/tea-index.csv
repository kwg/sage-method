# TEA (Test & Evaluation Agent) Index

**Status**: Placeholder

This file would contain an index of test architectures and evaluation frameworks.

## Structure

In a full implementation, this would be a CSV with columns:
- test_id

- knowledge_path
- status

## Current Status

Not implemented in SAGE standalone mode. This is a placeholder to satisfy workflow references.
